                    <h2>Micro Center</h2>
                    <p>In the middle of June my family drove up to California for a family birthday party. The part happened to be really close to a Micro Center store so I asked if we could stop by durring the trip. It was a ton of fun, and I ended up buying myself a new CPU, a 5800X.</p>

                <h2>Lock Picking</h2>
                    <p>At work, there was a lockbox on a door that needed to be unlocked because we replaced the door handle. We didn't have the key to the lockbox because it was owned by the electrical company. In order to put the lockbox on the new door handle we needed to pick it open. I found a video on Youtube and me and my boss took about 30 minutes to pick it open. Since then I my boss and I have competitions to see who can pick a certain lock faster, he is a lot better than me.</p>
